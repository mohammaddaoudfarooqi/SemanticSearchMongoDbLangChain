# Semantic Search using LangChain and MongoDB Atlas
Introduction
Semantic search refers to a search technique that aims to improve the accuracy of search results by understanding the intent and context behind a user’s query. Unlike traditional keyword-based search engines, which rely on matching specific words or phrases, semantic search focuses on the meaning of the query and the content of the documents.

Semantic search systems use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to comprehend the context, relationships, and semantics of words and phrases. This allows them to deliver more relevant results by considering the user’s intent and the context of the query.

Some key components of semantic search include:

Context Understanding: Semantic search engines analyze the context of a query, taking into account factors such as user location, previous search history, and the relationships between words.
Entity Recognition: Identifying and understanding entities (e.g., people, places, and things) in the query and the documents being searched can enhance the accuracy of results.
Concept Matching: Semantic search systems go beyond simple keyword matching and attempt to match the underlying concepts or meanings in the query and documents.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP techniques are employed to understand the natural language in queries and documents, helping the search engine better interpret and respond to user input.
Machine Learning: Algorithms learn from patterns and user behavior, continuously improving the relevance of search results over time.
Semantic search is particularly beneficial for complex queries, ambiguous language, and situations where users may not use the exact keywords that would typically yield the desired results. It has applications in various fields, including information retrieval, recommendation systems, and question-answering systems.
